I'm not particularly happy about killing my generator, but it was either choosing an off-the-shelf option or reimplementing a parser for a Markdown-based Racket <code>#lang</code> that let me escape to Racket in a similar way to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/index.html>Pollen</a> and rewriting my (admittedly not very long tail of) previous posts in this new language, and I wasn't making much progress on that front.<p>Why throw out the old stack? Well, I had a few annoyances about how it worked. First of all, the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://docs.racket-lang.org/markdown/index.html>Markdown library</a> I was using did not handle Markdown extensions like tables, and there wasn't a way I could plug into the parser to implement those or add custom elements such as <em>Cool Bear's hot tips</em> from <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://fasterthanli.me/>@fasterthanlime's blog</a>.<p>Then there was the problem of footnotes: the library generates unstable IDs for footnotes, so every time I regenerated the blog every single ID would change, which was annoying and led me to this cycle of generating the blog, then manually <code>git restore</code>ing every page that was not supposed to be touched by the change. It was all a bit laborious. I'd also like to implement footnotes in the sidebar, and again, the library made it all kind of tedious.<p>These were not insurmountable problems. I could probably embed the library into the generator and hook into the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://docs.racket-lang.org/sxml-intro/index.html>SXML</a> emitter to change the output it produces. I just never felt like doing that. Maybe I just don't like working in Racket anymore because it's generally untyped and its <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/>typed variant</a> is excruciatingly slow and often very annoying to work with.<p>It took me a few hours of work to get Zola running and redesign the blog. I wrote a custom template, changed all the fonts, finally added support for <a href=/tags/>tags</a>, made sure that all the old posts would render correctly, and aliased all the old URLs to the new ones. Zola has a built-in server with live reload that made this process much quicker. It was all very easy.<p>I went with Zola entirely based on vibes, but I think I like its approach. It tries to generalize some standard things you'd want in a blog into more powerful concepts: posts become a <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/pages-sections/>section with pages</a>, tags become one of many <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://www.getzola.org/documentation/templates/taxonomies/>taxonomies</a> that the website can have. Just about every template is customizable. It looks very fast: my whole blog renders in a hundred milliseconds, which sounds about right. I also set up its premade GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the blog to GitHub pages.<p>I can't say I <em>enjoy</em> writing <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://keats.github.io/tera>Tera</a> templates and this was one of the issues that made me procrastinate the switch to an off-the-shelf generator, but honestly, they're fine. The one thing I dislike is that they're orthogonal to the text they produce, so a few times during the template writing process I ended up with invalid HTML. I'm not happy about that, but sometimes you just have to compromise.<p>I took some inspiration from <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html>Devine Lu Linvega's website</a> for the top bar. You can find the fonts that I used on the <a href=/meta/>meta</a> page: I think they look nice.<p>There are some things that I'd like to implement in the future:<ul><li>Footnotes in the sidebar, as I previously mentioned.<li>Comments? I wouldn't want to use a third-party thing, especially not after I read that <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://ryansouthgate.com/goodbye-disqus/>Disqus injects tons of ads into your page</a>, so maybe I'll hack some custom solution together.<li>I had this idea that I could publish this blog as an <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://anil.recoil.org/notes/atproto-for-fun-and-blogging>AT proto</a> thing just because I think it would be cool, but that probably involves changing the whole stack again. Something to think about for the future.</ul><p>In conclusion, hats off to Zola for making the migration process very painless, and I hope this improved process will make me more likely to write posts on here.</div></article></main><footer class=main><a class=logo href=/> <svg viewbox="0 0 79 49" version=1.1 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg xmlns:svg=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><title>Steen's online burrow</title><g fill=currentColor><g><path d="M 17,7 V 9 H 15 V 8 h -1 v 3 h 1 v 1 h 2 v 1 h 4 V 9 H 20 V 8 H 19 V 5 h 1 V 4 h 1 V 3 h 4 v 1 h -3 v 3 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 4 h -1 v 1 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 H 16 V 13 H 13 V 12 10 H 12 V 8 h 1 V 7 Z"/><path d="m 30,5 v 1 h 2 V 5 h 3 v 1 h -2 v 1 h -2 v 4 h -1 v 1 h -1 v 1 h -1 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -1 v -3 h 1 v -2 h 1 V 7 H 26 V 6 H 24 V 5 Z"/><path d="m 39,5 v 2 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -2 v 1 h 4 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -2 v -1 h -3 v 1 h -1 v 2 h 2 v -1 h 3 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -2 v -1 h -4 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -4 v -1 h 1 v -2 h 1 v -2 h 1 V 8 h 3 V 7 h 1 V 6 h 1 V 5 Z"/><path d="m 42,5 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 2 v 1 H 44 V 9 h -1 v 2 h 3 v 1 h -2 v 1 h -1 v 1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v 2 h -4 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -2 v -2 h 1 V 9 H 41 V 7 H 40 V 5 Z"/><path d="m 48,6 v 2 h 1 v 4 h 1 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -1 v 3 c 0,0 1,0 1,0 v -1 h 1 v -2 h 1 v -2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 2 V 14 H 56 V 9 h 1 V 7 h 1 V 5 h 1 V 4 h 1 V 2 h -1 v 1 h -2 v 1 h -1 v 4 h -1 v 4 H 54 V 11 H 53 V 10 H 51 V 8 H 50 V 7 H 49 V 6 Z"/><path d="m 61,0 v 1 h 1 v 3 h 2 V 2 H 63 V 0 Z"/><path d="m 67,4 v 1 h -1 v 2 h 1 c 0,0 0,3 0,3 h -1 v 1 c 0,0 -4,0 -4,0 v -1 h 2 V 9 h 1 V 8 H 64 V 5 h 1 V 4 Z"/></g><g><path d="m 26,22 h 3 v -1 h -3 z"/><path d="m 31,20 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v -2 z m 1,2 h -1 v -1 h -1 v 2 h 2 z"/><path d="m 34,20 v 3 h 1 v -2 h 1 v 2 h 1 v -2 h -1 v -1 z"/><path d="m 38,19 v 4 h 1 v -4 z"/><path d="m 40,19 v 1 h 1 v -1 z"/><path d="m 40,21 v 2 h 1 v -2 z"/><path d="m 42,23 v -3 h 2 v 1 h 1 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v 2 z"/><path d="m 46,21 v 2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v -1 h -1 v -2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v -2 h -2 v 1 z"/><path d="m 50,21 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h 3 v -1 z"/></g><g><path d="m 5,26 v 1 H 4 v 6 H 3 v 7 H 2 v 4 H 1 v 2 H 0 v 3 h 6 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v -4 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -2 h 1 v -2 h 1 v -1 h 1 v -1 h 1 V 28 H 12 V 27 H 9 v -1 z m 2,4 h 2 v 1 h 3 v 2 h -1 v 1 h -1 v 1 H 9 v 1 H 8 v 1 H 6 V 36 H 7 Z M 6,41 h 2 v 1 h 2 v 1 H 8 v 1 H 6 v 1 H 5 v -2 h 1 z"/><path d="m 17,26 v 3 h 1 v 2 h -1 v 5 h -1 v 4 h -1 v 4 h 1 v 2 h 9 v -1 h 1 v -3 h 1 V 25 h -4 v 5 h 1 v 9 h -1 v 3 h -1 v 1 h -3 v -4 h 1 v -5 h 1 v -8 z"/><path d="m 28,27 v 5 h 1 v 2 h -1 v 14 h 3 V 38 h 1 v 4 h 1 v 4 h 1 v 2 h 3 v -5 h -1 v -4 h -1 v -5 h 3 v -6 h -2 v -1 z m 4,3 h 1 v 1 h -1 z"/><path d="m 40,27 v 21 h 3 V 37 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 2 h 4 v -3 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -9 h -2 v -1 z m 3,4 h 2 v 1 h -1 v 1 h -1 z"/><path d="m 52,27 v 1 h -1 v 1 h -1 v 7 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 5 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 1 v -8 h -1 v -1 h -4 v -1 z m 2,4 h 3 v 1 h 1 v 2 h -1 v 1 h -2 v -1 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -1 h 1 z"/><path d="m 63,25 v 4 h 1 v 16 h 4 v -1 h 1 v -1 h 1 v -2 h 2 v 1 h 2 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 4 v -5 h -1 v -3 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -3 h -1 v -1 h -3 v 4 h 1 v 3 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 1 h -1 v -1 h -4 v 1 H 67 V 26 h -1 v -1 z"/></g></g></svg> </a><div class=blurb>There is no end though there is a start in the past — Infinity.<br> It speaks, it ruins, and it goes though it consumes the soul — Finite.<br> Only the person who has wisdom can read the most foolish one from the history.<br> The daemon that lives in the machine doesn't understand the daemon that lives in the brain.<br> It is funnier that man exceeds the speed of light than machine start writing on a net.<br> It can be said that this is final ultimatum from the people who can think.</div></footer></div>

It's a game about walking up a mountain by putting one foot in front of the other, and in the process it explores masculinity and how hard it is to accept help from others. I find that I have a lot more in common with Nate, the game's coveralls-wearing manchild protagonist and player character, than I would like to admit.<p>I'm a self-taught programmer. After failing to get into the product design course at the Politecnico di Torino I enrolled into CS at UniTo because I'd been dabbling in computers since I was a kid, and in programming in the years leading up to my graduation from a linguistic lyceum. I did not attend a single course of the CS program. I don't even know what the CS department looks like because I never set foot into it. I'd planned a trip to, of all places, an anime convention with some friends I had made on the internet, and the trip just happened to overlap with the first few days of courses at the university. After I came back from the convention I figured that ship had sailed and I would not be able to bear the shame of missing the first day of uni. In the mornings I would pretend to take the train to uni, and instead go walking in the woods around my town. I was not in a good place mentally.<p>Nevertheless, I kept programming. Eventually my father figured out that I was not going to uni. He let me stay home for the rest of the year until I figured things out. I learned Elm and OCaml. The sabbatical year turned into two. I learned TypeScript and React and made some small websites. Now I had to find a job. I rewrote the imageboard that kickstarted my interest in programming in Ur/Web. On the cusp of the third year, I got hired at a consultancy agency by some kind people who were sort of amused by the way I told them about these projects.<p>During this time I developed a narrative for myself to cling on to. That's what you have to do when you're in a bad spot; you tell yourself whatever horseshit you need to keep yourself sane. I convinced myself that I was better than the average programmer, and certainly better than the people who came out of uni having only taken a cursory glance at Java and C++. Not only that but I'd come all this way by myself, so I didn't need help from others. I was <em>proud</em> of my skills and my self-reliance.<p>That pride begat a lot of traits that I carry with me to this day. Sometimes I find it hard to ask for help, particularly when I'm already knee-deep into a problem. I refuse to use project templates. If a library gives me a problem I'd rather reimplement it myself from first principles than figuring out how to fix it upstream. I generally don't like working in other people's code. If I have to choose between using a library that would be completely fine for my purposes and reimplementing the parts I need myself, I'll choose the shortest route to yak shaving any day of the week.<p>I'm a competitive yak shaver. I've been wanting to revamp this blog for a while, but I always get stuck on the part where I have to reimplement the markdown parser. The production-level ones are clearly not up to the task because they don't produce the HTML output that I want, and I think I could do better anyway. I burn out on my own projects on a regular basis. Thank fuck I can turn to videogames when that happens.<p>Oh, right, videogames. Baby Steps. Where were we?<p>Baby Steps is partly about learning to accept help. It's not easy to do that; you have to swallow your pride and accept that the help you're getting may not be in the form that you envisioned. It took me a long time to convince myself to use <a rel="nofollow noreferrer external" class=external-link href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a> to set up this blog when I don't really like the templating language it uses and I know that I could just as well write my own static site generator with a principled templating language and blackjack and hookers, given enough time.<p>But that's just the thing: time. I work a full-time job and I have many other things to think about other than implementing the perfect templating language. I don't have the energy to do all of that. And Zola is pretty damn good anyway.<p>I think I need to learn to accept that compromises are good, actually. That I can't do everything myself. That I don't need to do everything myself. That other people's code is often better than my own, and that flawed code that exists is infinitely better than better code that doesn't. That I should be getting help in any way I can.</div></article></main><footer class=main><a class=logo href=/> <svg viewbox="0 0 79 49" version=1.1 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg xmlns:svg=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><title>Steen's online burrow</title><g fill=currentColor><g><path d="M 17,7 V 9 H 15 V 8 h -1 v 3 h 1 v 1 h 2 v 1 h 4 V 9 H 20 V 8 H 19 V 5 h 1 V 4 h 1 V 3 h 4 v 1 h -3 v 3 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 4 h -1 v 1 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 H 16 V 13 H 13 V 12 10 H 12 V 8 h 1 V 7 Z"/><path d="m 30,5 v 1 h 2 V 5 h 3 v 1 h -2 v 1 h -2 v 4 h -1 v 1 h -1 v 1 h -1 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -1 v -3 h 1 v -2 h 1 V 7 H 26 V 6 H 24 V 5 Z"/><path d="m 39,5 v 2 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -2 v 1 h 4 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -2 v -1 h -3 v 1 h -1 v 2 h 2 v -1 h 3 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -2 v -1 h -4 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -4 v -1 h 1 v -2 h 1 v -2 h 1 V 8 h 3 V 7 h 1 V 6 h 1 V 5 Z"/><path d="m 42,5 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 2 v 1 H 44 V 9 h -1 v 2 h 3 v 1 h -2 v 1 h -1 v 1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v 2 h -4 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h -2 v -2 h 1 V 9 H 41 V 7 H 40 V 5 Z"/><path d="m 48,6 v 2 h 1 v 4 h 1 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -1 v 3 c 0,0 1,0 1,0 v -1 h 1 v -2 h 1 v -2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 2 V 14 H 56 V 9 h 1 V 7 h 1 V 5 h 1 V 4 h 1 V 2 h -1 v 1 h -2 v 1 h -1 v 4 h -1 v 4 H 54 V 11 H 53 V 10 H 51 V 8 H 50 V 7 H 49 V 6 Z"/><path d="m 61,0 v 1 h 1 v 3 h 2 V 2 H 63 V 0 Z"/><path d="m 67,4 v 1 h -1 v 2 h 1 c 0,0 0,3 0,3 h -1 v 1 c 0,0 -4,0 -4,0 v -1 h 2 V 9 h 1 V 8 H 64 V 5 h 1 V 4 Z"/></g><g><path d="m 26,22 h 3 v -1 h -3 z"/><path d="m 31,20 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v -2 z m 1,2 h -1 v -1 h -1 v 2 h 2 z"/><path d="m 34,20 v 3 h 1 v -2 h 1 v 2 h 1 v -2 h -1 v -1 z"/><path d="m 38,19 v 4 h 1 v -4 z"/><path d="m 40,19 v 1 h 1 v -1 z"/><path d="m 40,21 v 2 h 1 v -2 z"/><path d="m 42,23 v -3 h 2 v 1 h 1 c 0,0 0,2 0,2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v 2 z"/><path d="m 46,21 v 2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v -1 h -1 v -2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v -2 h -2 v 1 z"/><path d="m 50,21 c 0,0 0,1 0,1 h 3 v -1 z"/></g><g><path d="m 5,26 v 1 H 4 v 6 H 3 v 7 H 2 v 4 H 1 v 2 H 0 v 3 h 6 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 2 v -4 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -2 h 1 v -2 h 1 v -1 h 1 v -1 h 1 V 28 H 12 V 27 H 9 v -1 z m 2,4 h 2 v 1 h 3 v 2 h -1 v 1 h -1 v 1 H 9 v 1 H 8 v 1 H 6 V 36 H 7 Z M 6,41 h 2 v 1 h 2 v 1 H 8 v 1 H 6 v 1 H 5 v -2 h 1 z"/><path d="m 17,26 v 3 h 1 v 2 h -1 v 5 h -1 v 4 h -1 v 4 h 1 v 2 h 9 v -1 h 1 v -3 h 1 V 25 h -4 v 5 h 1 v 9 h -1 v 3 h -1 v 1 h -3 v -4 h 1 v -5 h 1 v -8 z"/><path d="m 28,27 v 5 h 1 v 2 h -1 v 14 h 3 V 38 h 1 v 4 h 1 v 4 h 1 v 2 h 3 v -5 h -1 v -4 h -1 v -5 h 3 v -6 h -2 v -1 z m 4,3 h 1 v 1 h -1 z"/><path d="m 40,27 v 21 h 3 V 37 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 2 h 4 v -3 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -9 h -2 v -1 z m 3,4 h 2 v 1 h -1 v 1 h -1 z"/><path d="m 52,27 v 1 h -1 v 1 h -1 v 7 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 5 v -1 h 2 v -1 h 1 v -8 h -1 v -1 h -4 v -1 z m 2,4 h 3 v 1 h 1 v 2 h -1 v 1 h -2 v -1 h -1 v -1 h -1 v -1 h 1 z"/><path d="m 63,25 v 4 h 1 v 16 h 4 v -1 h 1 v -1 h 1 v -2 h 2 v 1 h 2 v 1 h 1 v 1 h 4 v -5 h -1 v -3 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -2 h -1 v -3 h -1 v -1 h -3 v 4 h 1 v 3 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 2 h 1 v 1 h -1 v -1 h -4 v 1 H 67 V 26 h -1 v -1 z"/></g></g></svg> </a><div class=blurb>There is no end though there is a start in the past — Infinity.<br> It speaks, it ruins, and it goes though it consumes the soul — Finite.<br> Only the person who has wisdom can read the most foolish one from the history.<br> The daemon that lives in the machine doesn't understand the daemon that lives in the brain.<br> It is funnier that man exceeds the speed of light than machine start writing on a net.<br> It can be said that this is final ultimatum from the people who can think.</div></footer></div>

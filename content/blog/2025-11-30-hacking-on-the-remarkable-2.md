Since last Wednesday, I am the proud owner of a [reMarkable 2](https://remarkable.com/products/remarkable-2). There was a black friday discount and some refurbished deals that meant I could get the tablet, the Marker Plus and the book cover for a little over the asking price of the base tablet and marker so I decided to take advantage of it.

The reMarkable is marketed as a distraction-free reading and writing device, and I can confirm that it excels at writing. The friction of the stylus on the epaper display feels just right, the latency is low enough that it resembles writing with ink that takes a few instants to set on the page, and you can customize the brush enough to achieve the effect you want. I haven't written this much since I was in high school and I think I kind of missed it.

The Marker Plus includes an eraser on the other end of the stylus; if you're thinking of getting one of these things I'd recommend spending a bit more to get this version of the marker because I can imagine erasing things to get very annoying. The other options you have for erasing are a two-tap gesture to undo the last stroke (which I use a lot to delete the last letter if it didn't turn out right), and a selection eraser tool which is useful for deleting entire paragraphs.

The touch gestures are a bit hit or miss: they don't always register and it feels like you need a bit more force than you might expect to use them. Navigating with the stylus is much more consistent, but some things (turning pages) you can only do with touch gestures. The reMarkable 1 used to have three physical buttons below the screen, and I wish the second iteration had kept those.

Reading PDFs is serviceable (papers are kind of annoying to read because you have to zoom in just a little to read comfortably) and I haven't tested ebooks yet.

One of the reasons why I wanted to get an epaper tablet was to read sheet music. I sing in a choir and we have a concert coming up during which we won't be allowed to use regular tablets due to the backlighting, and it felt like the perfect excuse to get one of these things to play with.

Reading sheet music is not great on the reMarkable. The refresh rate while turning pages is serviceable, and annotating PDFs with the stylus is a great experience, but there's a few great features I have gotten used to on MobileSheets on my tablet that the reMarkable does not support:

- Cropping pages so that the lyrics are actually readable.
- Half-page turning. When you turn a page in MobileSheets, you can set it to overlay half of the next page on the current one so you can follow the last bar while being able to eye the one on the next page.
- Turning pages with a single touch. Did I mention I don't like swipe gestures on this thing?

Hi! I go by steen online and Francesco offline, and this is my online burrow.

I'm a programmer by trade and I like most things related to functional programming, static types, and Nix.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/steinuil), [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/~steinuil), browse [my Nix system flake](https://kirarin.hootr.club/git/steinuil/flakes), ping me on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat/), [hackint](https://hackint.org/) or [rizon](https://rizon.net/) at `steenuil`, or send me an email at `steen@neets.work`.

### My stuff

- [kamelåså](https://github.com/steinuil/kameloso/) is what I like to call a Local Area Media Party application. It's like Spotify Jam, but built on top of [mpv](https://mpv.io/).

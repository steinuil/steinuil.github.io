It&rsquo;s been going on for about three and a half years and we thought it&rsquo;d be about time to make a bot that handles voting and backlog and times for us, so we started writing one, in F#.</p><p>My Raspberry Pi running NixOS is on 24/7, so I thought I could run the bot from there and learn something about packaging on Nix while doing so.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I have very little experience with packaging in Nix. If you spot any mistakes please tell me and I&rsquo;ll correct them!</p></div><hr /><div class="text"><p>First I thought I could cross-compile the bot and then just run the compiled version, so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to bother with packaging the dependencies. Cross-compiling a .NET Core program using the <code>dotnet</code> cli is very easy, you just have to specify the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog">runtime identifier</a> and use the <code>--self-contained</code> flag so the target machine doesn&rsquo;t need to have the .NET runtime installed to run it.</p></div><pre class="brush: shell"><code>$ dotnet publish --self-contained -r linux-arm64 -c Release</code></pre><div class="text"><p>I sent the output to the pi and inspected it with <code>ldd</code>. Running binaries on NixOS is <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Packaging/Binaries">not as easy</a> as on other Linux distros, because the paths to the dynamically loaded libraries are not predictable, so those hardcoded in the source are usually wrong.</p><p>I tried to patch the binary with <code>patchelf</code> but didn&rsquo;t have much luck; even when I did manage to make it run it just printed this message:</p></div><pre><code>No usable version of libssl was found</code></pre><div class="text"><p>And then dumped core. Later I learned that I could probably have avoided almost everything below this point, but at the moment I didn&rsquo;t so I decided to just do it the hard way.</p></div><h2 class="heading" id="the-first-derivation">The first derivation</h2><div class="text"><p>I cloned the repository on the Pi and quickly discovered that the <code>dotnet-sdk</code> package did not support arm64. This was easy enough to fix; I downloaded the .nix file and modified the URL and the hash to point to the <code>linux-arm64</code> version of the SDK. (I promise I&rsquo;ll upstream support for arm64 eventually, but for the moment it&rsquo;s just on my machine.)</p><p>It worked well enough; I could build the bot.

I started by copying the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jb55/b8b49893e18b61fb8c3ea3c924358278">aforementioned gist</a>, which got the list of all direct and transitive dependencies from the <code>obj/project.assets.json</code> file. I didn&rsquo;t want to install Node though, so I rewrote the script in F#.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a problem with the script though: the dependencies file specifies a base64-encoded sha512 hash which doesn&rsquo;t correspond to the hash of the zip file, and probably not to the <a href="https://www.mankier.com/1/nix-hash">Nix serialization of the path</a> either.</p><p>The hashes that Nix uses are also not at all like the ones you see in the wild; they use too many characters for hex, but also too few for base64. In fact Nix uses its own version of base32, more compact than base16 but still only containing ASCII digits and lowercase letters (except e o u t, which were chosen <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/no-hashes-starting-with-e-t-o-or-u-in-nix-store/4906/7">to reduce the chance of the hash containing swearwords</a>). The implementation is specified in <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/master/src/libutil/hash.cc#L76">src/libutil/hash.cc</a> and it&rsquo;s very compact and easily ported to other languages.

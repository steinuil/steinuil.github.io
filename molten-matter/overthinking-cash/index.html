Since I need to show the bills and coins on the screen at scale, I need to know their color and their dimensions, and here comes the first issue: coins only need a width, but banknotes also need a height, so I can&rsquo;t use the same type for both.</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>interface Coin&lt;Amount&gt; {
  amount: Amount;
  color: string;
  width: number;
}

interface Banknote&lt;Amount&gt; {
  amount: Amount;
  color: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
}</code></pre><div class="text"><p>Then we need to effectively store these values inside an object, so we can use TypeScript&rsquo;s mapped types for that. <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/1213">Higher-kinded types</a> unfortunately aren&rsquo;t yet in the language, so since we&rsquo;re parametrizing on the cash amounts we can&rsquo;t generalize this type to a <code>CashMap&lt;Amount extends number, Cash&lt;Amount&gt;&gt;</code> type constructor.</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>type CoinMap&lt;Amount extends number&gt; = {
  readonly [A in Amount]: Coin&lt;A&gt;
};

type BanknoteMap&lt;Amount extends number&gt; = {
  readonly [A in Amount]: Banknote&lt;A&gt;
};</code></pre><div class="text"><p>Now we can query the bills separately when we know what they are, and even if we don&rsquo;t we can just ad a check at the call site to select the correct object based on the amount.</p><p>But why stop here? <code>(a &lt; 500 ? coinsByAmount : banknotesByAmount)[a]</code> is not an idiom that plays very well with TypeScript, and since TypeScript 2.8 introduced <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-8.html">conditional types</a>, we can do even better. Let&rsquo;s define a type that returns the correct type based on the amount.</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>type ByAmount&lt;
  CoinAmount,
  BanknoteAmount,
  Amount extends CoinAmount | BanknoteAmount
&gt; = Amount extends CoinAmount     ? Coin&lt;Amount&gt;
  : Amount extends BanknoteAmount ? Banknote&lt;Amount&gt;
  : never;</code></pre><div class="text"><p>And now we can define a function that takes both maps and returns the correct bill or coin along with its correct type based on the type of the argument. That&rsquo;s dependent typing! (Sort of.)</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>const byAmount = &lt;
  CoinAmount extends number,
  BanknoteAmount extends number,
  Amount extends CoinAmount | BanknoteAmount
&gt;(
  coinsByAmount: CoinMap&lt;CoinAmount&gt;,
  banknotesByAmount: BanknoteMap&lt;BanknoteAmount&gt;,
  isBanknote: (amount: Amount) =&gt; boolean,
  amount: Amount
): ByAmount&lt;CoinAmount, BanknoteAmount, Amount&gt; =&gt;
  ((isBanknote(amount)
    ? banknotesByAmount
    : coinsByAmount
  ) as any)[amount];</code></pre><div class="text"><p>You might be feeling a bit disappointed to the cast to <code>any</code> in the actual implementation, as did I&hellip; but it turns out that the compiler isn&rsquo;t actually capable of resolving a conditional type depending on a free generic type parameter.</p><p>You could resolve this without resorting to a cast by writing two different function signatures, one like the one I wrote above for the interface and another, more permissive, to type-check the implementation, but verifying correctness in this case is trivial, so I don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s worth the effort.</p></div><header id="plugging-in-a-currency">Plugging in a currency</header><div class="text"><p>Coming from OCaml, I imagined all of the above packaged up in a neat parametrized module, or <em>functor</em> in ML vernacular, with which you&rsquo;d only have to implement a few values and types and you&rsquo;d get back another module with all the types and useful functions implemented automagically.</p><p>Unfortunately higher-order modules as an idiom are pretty much unheard of outside of SML and OCaml, and so too does TypeScript ignore them. As a result, there&rsquo;s a bit of boilerplate involved in actually using the constructors I defined above with a currency.</p><p>First, we define all the denominations.</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>type EuroCoinAmount = 1 | 2 | 5 | 10 | 20 | 50 | 100 | 200;
type EuroBanknoteAmount = 500 | 1000 | 2000 | 5000 | 10000 | 20000 | 50000;
type EuroAmount = EuroCoinAmount | EuroBanknoteAmount;</code></pre><div class="text"><p>Then we can fill in the maps.</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>const euroCoinsByAmount: CoinMap&lt;EuroCoinAmount&gt; = {
  1: {
    amount: 1,
    width: 16,
  },
  2: {
    amount: 2,
    width: 18.5,
  },
  ...
};</code></pre><div class="text"><p>Note that, since I passed the indexing key (<code>A</code>) rather than the more general type (<code>Amount</code>) as parameter to each cash type in the definition of CoinMap, not only do I get errors for when I don&rsquo;t include one of the denominations in the map, for misspells in the keys and in the <code>amount</code> fields, but even when the value in the <code>amount</code> field does not match the indexing key:</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>...
  10: {
    amount: 20,
    ^^^^^^ error: Type '20' is not assignable to type '10'.
    width: 22,
  },</code></pre><div class="text"><p>The implementation of the <code>euroByAmount</code> function is also trivial, if a bit verbose. Here <code>Amount</code> extends <code>EuroAmount</code> rather than the more general <code>number</code> so we can get some additional type-checking when using the function.</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>const euroByAmount = &lt;Amount extends EuroAmount&gt;(amount: Amount) =&gt;
  byAmount&lt;EuroCoinAmount, EuroBanknoteAmount, Amount&gt;(
    euroCoinsByAmount,
    euroBanknotesByAmount,
    (a) =&gt; a &gt; 200,
    amount
  );</code></pre><div class="text"><p>And indeed, the function will return the correct type based on its argument, and even fail <em>at compile time</em> when called with an amount that&rsquo;s not a valid denomination!</p></div><pre class="brush: typescript"><code>euroByAmount(500); // Banknote&lt;500&gt;
euroByAmount(2);   // Coin&lt;2&gt;
euroByAmount(3);
             ^ error: Argument of type '3' is not assignable to parameter of type 'EuroAmount'.</code></pre><header id="a-sad-conclusion">A sad conclusion</header><div class="text"><p>Admittedly this would have worked better if TypeScript had something akin to SML and OCaml&rsquo;s parametrized modules, or <em>functors</em> in ML vernacular.</p><p>Functors are a great pattern for writing code whose implementation can easily be swapped and would fit in really well with Javascript&rsquo;s module system; combined with the advanced features of TypeScript&rsquo;s type system I think they would make for a really nice addition to the language.</p><p>Unfortunately functors are almost completely unheard of outside of the SML/OCaml world, and so we&rsquo;re stuck with this boilerplateful jank. Sad!</p></div></main><footer>this web sight made with <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>.</footer></div></body></html>

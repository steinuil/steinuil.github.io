I started out with Vim, but I managed to live with Emacs for a while, and nowadays I mostly use VS Code and I know the basics of Visual Studio and some JetBrains IDEs. To complement these I use bash and Powershell, despite not being a huge fan of either.</p><p>Most of these tools have wildly different interaction modes and differ a lot in their finer details, so to stay sane I always install a Vim emulation layer when setting them up on a new machine: going by popularity it&rsquo;s Evil for Emacs, VsCodeVim for VS Code, VsVim for Visual Studio, and whatever the IntelliJ one is called. (By the way, I really appreciate that IntelliJ asks you whether you want to install its Vim plugin in the first-time setup wizard.)</p><p>Of course you can&rsquo;t perfectly emulate Vim on anything that isn&rsquo;t Vim itself, and even on the infinitely extensible Emacs you&rsquo;ll eventually run into some issues with plugins that don&rsquo;t play well with it. Honestly I&rsquo;m ok with this; Vim runs on all the platforms I could possibly care about and if I choose to use something different it&rsquo;s because I find value in the features of that environment that wouldn&rsquo;t work as well on Vim.</p><p>So the bone to pick I have with these emulation plugins is not that they don&rsquo;t emulate Vim to perfection, but that they <em>try too hard to</em>.</p></div><header class="heading" id="faking-vim">Faking vim</header><div class="text"><p>VsCodeVim actually keeps its own undo history. The implementation is really complex: it has to comply to whatever it is that vim does to the keystroke, or else <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/1490#issuecomment-296455784">angry mobs</a> will show up in the issue tracker to complain. Because of this complexity and of Vim&rsquo;s compositional nature any bug in the implementation will likely break a bunch of other features, and sure enough there&rsquo;s no shortage of bugs related to the undo stack in the issue tracker.</p><p>I prefer to just <a href="https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim/issues/2007#issuecomment-329660927">turn it off</a>.</p><p>Another thing that bother me is that the ex commands show up in VS Code&rsquo;s tiny status bar rather than in the command palette where they would fit much better. Apparently it used to work this way but was changed due to limitations in the extension API. Search is also awkwardly implemented as a completely separate function from VS Code&rsquo;s native search, so I can use it to quickly jump to something but it&rsquo;s useless to visually scan the file because it doesn&rsquo;t hightlight matches.</p></div></main><footer>made with <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">racket</a> :: <a href="/rss.xml">rss</a> :: <a href="/feed.xml">atom</a></footer></div></body></html>
